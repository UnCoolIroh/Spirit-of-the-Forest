Game Title: Spirit of the Forest

Brief Elevator Pitch Describing Game: Spirit of the Forest is a fast-paced roguelike where you can switch between your base druid form and your bear form and attack and defeat enemies in procedurally generated dungeons. Upgrade and get stronger or more durable to tackle the levels.

Game Controls: The game is designed to be played with a controller (minus the menus). Move around with the left stick, attack with the west button (square on playstation), transform into the bear or back into the druid with the south button (x on playstation) with a 4 second cooldown between uses, interact with the east button (circle on play). You can also attack with the right shoulder button, if you so choose. Within levels you must defeat the enemies in a room to clear it and move on to the other rooms, and you must clear every room to move on to the next level.

Available Content: There are three levels of randomly generated maps and the features available are: main gameplay loop, procedural room generation, attribute upgrades (interact with the character in the hub and use gems earned in rooms to strengthen your attack or raise your health).

Lessons Learned: 
It's extremely difficult and time-consuming, especially if you're trying to do something new. Most techniques aren't based on anything you'd traditionally be taught in any sort of coding class, so it's absolutely necessary to go learn from other, more-experienced developers.

You will have to throw away a lot of ideas to actually get to make what you are capable of creating. Many things sound great on paper but when implemented turn out to be horrendous ideas, or more often than not simply unimplementable.

Game development takes a while, so start early. We made the mistake of starting rather late, and our game ended up with significantly less content than we would have liked it to have.

Scope starting out is very important, you only have so much time to make a game and if you split attention in too many different directions, quality is bound to suffer.

Focus on figuring out your mechanics first, everything else can come naturally from there.
